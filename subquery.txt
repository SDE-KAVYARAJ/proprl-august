--->FUNCTIONS
-->aggregate functions
-->count
->count column rows
select count(productname) from product
select count(productname) from product where price<50--->null values are not counted
select avg(price) from product
select sum(price)from product
select min(price) as "smallest price" from product
select max(price) as "largest price" from product

-->group by-having

select productdescription,count(productdescription) from product group by productdescription


select productdescription,count(productname) from product group by productdescription



select productdescription,count(price) from product group by productdescription-->any column use to count

select count(productdescription) from product group by productdescription


select productdescription,min(price)from product group by productdescription having min(price)<50-->among that three result find the min


select productdescription,min(price)from product group by productdescription where min(price)<50-->not working where bcz more than one row is min(price)


--->date function

select sysdate from dual

-->select current_date from dual

select last day(sysdate) from dual

-->last month of current

select months_between(sysdate, date '2021-08-27') from dual-->past -->months between these two dates

select months_between(sysdate, date '2030-08-27') from dual-->negative future

--trunc->
select trunc(sysdate,'month')month from dual--->first day of the month

-->first day of this year
select trunc(sysdate,'year')year from dual

-->
select trunc(sysdate,'day')day from dual-->first date of the week

-->
select trunc(date '2024-08-27','day')day from dual-->first date of the week

-->extracting month,date,year from the system

-->
select extract(month from sysdate)month from dual

select extract(day from sysdate)day from dual

select extract(year from sysdate)year from dual

-->
select trunc(months_between(date '2050-08-27',sysdate)/12)as years_difference from dual

-->
arithmetic function
->ceil()

select 1561.010 as "number",ceil(1561.31)from dual--->this returns up value roubd

select ceil(152.11)from dual

select round(152.89)from dual

select round(152.89,1)from dual--->152.8

select round(152.89,2)from dual--->152.89

select initcap('kavy raj')from dual

select length('com sci')from dual

select substr('good mor',1)from dual

select substr('good morning',-5,4)from dual--->starting from 5 characters at the nd and 4 means the length of substring
